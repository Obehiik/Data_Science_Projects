# Logistic Regression Analysis of Risk Factors for Liver Fibrosis

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to identify and quantify key risk factors for liver fibrosis progression in patients with Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), to support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

## Key Findings & Impact:
- Analyzed clinical data from 215 NASH patients.
- Identified key comorbidities associated with fibrosis progression, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension.
- Quantified the risk through odds ratios and confidence intervals to provide insights for clinical risk assessment and management of NASH patients.

## Methods & Tools:
- **Analysis Method**: Multivariate logistic regression was applied to model the relationships between comorbidities and liver fibrosis progression.
- **R Programming**: 
  - Used for data preparation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
  - Comprehensive model diagnostics were performed to ensure the reliability and validity of the model.
- **Visualization**: Forest plots were created to clearly communicate the odds ratios and their confidence intervals, providing an easily interpretable summary of the results.
- **Robust Validation**: Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings.

## Files:
- `Proj_LogReg_LiverFib_NASH_RiskFactors.qmd`: Quarto markdown file used for data cleaning, logistic regression analysis, and visualization.

## Results:
The analysis revealed several statistically significant comorbidities associated with fibrosis progression, including:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome
- Hypertension

These findings can be used to inform clinical decision-making, guiding healthcare providers in the management and treatment of NASH patients.
