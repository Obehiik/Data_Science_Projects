# Introduction

In a U.S. Centers for Disease Control study, conducted in the state of Georgia from 1980 to 1992, linked data on live births to the same mother were obtained (Adams et al., 1997). This dataset contains a subset of data restricted to 878 mothers for whom five births were identified.Â 

The main variables of interest are maternal mage (the mother's mage at each birth) and infant birth weight.

Note that because each mother had five infant births, but at different maternal mages, maternal mage is a within-subject covariate.

Variable List:

mid:Mother ID

border: Birth Order

bweight: Birth Weight (in grams)

mage: Maternal mage (years)

cid: Child ID
