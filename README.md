# Data Science Project Showcase

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository features a variety of data analysis projects. Below are the project goals for each of them:

## 1.1 Longitudinal Analysis of Sex Differences in Cholesterol Trajectories | R  
**Project Goal:**  
Investigate how sex influences cholesterol changes over time using 10-year data from the Framingham Heart Study, aiming to inform sex-specific cardiovascular health management.

## 1.2 Logistic Regression Analysis of Risk Factors for Liver Fibrosis | R  
**Project Goal:**  
Identify and quantify key risk factors for liver fibrosis progression in NASH patients to support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

## 1.3 Heart Failure Mortality Analysis | R  
**Project Goal:**  
Evaluate how comorbidities (diabetes, anemia, high blood pressure) affect mortality risk in heart failure patients to improve risk assessment and treatment planning.

## 1.4 Additional Projects  
**Project Goal:**  
Work on additional analyses, including time series analysis, machine learning, and principal component analysis.
