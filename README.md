## Longitudinal Analysis of Sex Differences in Serum Cholesterol Trajectories

### Overview
This project investigates sex differences in serum cholesterol level trajectories over a 10-year period using data from the Framingham Heart Study.

- **Dataset**: Subset of Framingham Heart Study data with 2,634 participants
- **Methods**: Linear Mixed Effects Models, Generalized Estimating Equations

### Key Analyses
- Exploratory data analysis of cholesterol trajectories
- Comparison of different model specifications
- Hypothesis testing for sex differences in cholesterol change rates

### Highlights
- Comprehensive visualizations including spaghetti plots and correlation matrices
- Detailed model comparisons and selection process
- Interpretation of fixed and random effects
- Discussion of population-averaged vs subject-specific effects


## Logistic Regression Analysis of Risk Factors for Liver Fibrosis Progression

### Overview
This project analyzes risk factors associated with liver fibrosis progression in patients with Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).

- **Dataset**: Clinical data from 215 NASH patients
- **Methods**: Logistic regression, model diagnostics, sensitivity analysis

### Highlights
- Comprehensive visualizations including histograms, bar plots, and forest plots
- Identification of key risk factors for fibrosis progression
- Assessment of model performance and robustness


## Heart Failure Mortality Analysis

### Overview
This project involves a comprehensive survival analysis to evaluate the impact of key comorbidities on mortality risk in heart failure patients.

- **Dataset**: Heart failure patient clinical records
- **Methods**: Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards models

### Key Analyses
- Visualization of mortality trends
- Quantification of risk associations

### Highlights
- Kaplan-Meier curves for different risk factors
- Diagnostic plots for Cox models
- Interpretation of hazard ratios
